## The assignment

Download this repo and open the webproject in your editor and run the website. This project has some predefined styling and images inside, but you don't have to do anything with those. Edit the index.html so that the end result is more semantic and looks a bit more like this preview (this preview was heavily zoomed out):

Make sure that this edited website works on your local machine. 

## Submitting your work
Create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch.
Start a new **pull request**, select one **reviewer** and make sure to put the **GitHub Pages URL** in the comment section. Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
